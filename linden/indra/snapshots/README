This directory contains misc utils for streaming images to a ramdisk
Pass environment variable SNAPSHOT when starting the viewer to use this:

export SNAPSHOT=/tmp/viewer_displays/0

the viewer will then handle symlinking /tmp/viewer_displays/0/a.tga to current.tga and rendering to b.tga, and swapping the symlink as needed (thus providing a form of double-buffering)
